# Self-Organizing-Prompt-Optimization

## Overview
S.O.S. is an experimental AI system designed to automate prompt generation and evaluation using multiple specialized agents. The system allows users to create prompts for large language models (LLMs) and test their effectiveness across different tasks, without manual intervention.

## Features
- `Generate multiple prompts automatically for LLMs.`
- `Evaluate prompt outputs across various tasks.`
- `Use multiple AI agents to handle different types of prompts.`
- `Easy scalability: add more agents to improve coverage and diversity.`

## Technologies
- `Python`
- `Large Language Models (LLMs)`
- `Multi-agent architecture`

## Installation
