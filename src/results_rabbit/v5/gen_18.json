                "response": "An adult rabbit is a compact, endearing creature with several distinctive physical characteristics that set it apart from other animals. Here are the key features of an adult rabbit's appearance:\n\n1.  **Body Shape**: Rabbits have rounded bodies which provide them with protection and help to distribute their weight evenly. This rounded shape also enables them to easily turn corners while navigating through tight spaces.\n\n2.  **Size**: Rabbits come in a variety of sizes, but most domesticated rabbits fall within the range of 8-12 pounds (3.5-5.4 kg) and stand about 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) tall at the shoulder. Larger breeds can reach up to 20 pounds (9 kg) or more.\n\n3.  **Fur**: Rabbits are known for their thick, soft fur which helps protect them from the elements. Their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid, bi-color, calico, tortoiseshell, and agouti.\n\n4.  **Ears**: One of the most noticeable features of rabbits is their ears. They are relatively long compared to other mammals, which helps them detect potential predators or threats from afar.\n\n5.  **Facial Features**: Rabbits have several distinct facial features that contribute to their unique appearance. Their eyes are large and round, their noses are short and button-like, and they have prominent whiskers on their faces. These whiskers serve as an additional sensory organ, helping them navigate in the dark and detect potential threats.\n\n6.  **Legs and Feet**: Rabbits have long hind legs which enable them to jump and move quickly when necessary. Their front paws are smaller and more delicate compared to their hind paws, with five toes on each paw including a dewclaw which can sometimes be removed for safety reasons.\n\nOverall, the combination of these features makes adult rabbits one of the most recognizable animals in the world.",

                "response": "Here are the physical characteristics of an average adult rabbit:\n\n**Overall Size:**\nAn average adult rabbit typically weighs between 2-4 pounds (0.9-1.8 kg) and measures about 15-18 inches (38-46 cm) in length, including their head and body. They can reach a maximum height of around 6-7 inches (15-18 cm) at the shoulder.\n\n**Fur Type and Coloring:**\nRabbits have a thick, soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer coat that helps protect them from the elements. The fur type and coloring can vary depending on the breed, but most rabbits have:\n\n* A short to medium-length coat, with some breeds having longer or shorter coats\n* A thick undercoat that can be smooth or fluffy\n* A distinctive \"furnish\" (a layer of soft, fluffy hairs) on their face, around their eyes and mouth\n* Coat colors range from solid whites, blacks, grays, and browns to more complex patterns like agouti, pointed, or tortoiseshell\n\n**Ear Length and Position:**\nRabbits have relatively long ears compared to their head size. Their ears are:\n\n* Typically around 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) long\n* Situated on top of the head, slightly angled forward\n* Long enough to detect subtle changes in sound and temperature\n\n**Leg Strength and Proportions:**\nRabbits have powerful hind legs that enable them to jump and leap with great agility. Their front and rear legs are proportionate to their body size, with:\n\n* Strong hind legs that allow for jumping and propulsion\n* Smaller forelegs that support the rabbit's weight when standing or walking\n* Long, strong claws on all four paws that help with digging and grasping\n\n**Other Physical Characteristics:**\n\n* Rabbits have a compact, rounded body shape, often referred to as \"apple-shaped\" due to their large hindquarters and smaller shoulders.\n* Their eyes are relatively small but highly mobile, allowing them to detect movement and changes in their surroundings.\n* Rabbits have no external tail (their spine ends at the hip), which is an adaptation for burrowing and agility.\n\nKeep in mind that these characteristics can vary depending on the rabbit breed. Some breeds, such as the Flemish Giant or the Mini Lop, may exhibit significantly different physical traits than others.",

                "response": "A healthy adult rabbit typically has distinct physical characteristics that set them apart from other animals. Here are some common features found in a typical adult rabbit:\n\n**Length:**\nThe average length of an adult rabbit depends on the breed, but for most breeds, it can range between 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) in height at the shoulder and 14 to 22 inches (35-55 cm) in length from nose to tail. Larger breeds, such as Flemish Giants or Continental Giants, can reach up to 3 feet (90 cm) or more in length.\n\n**Fur texture:**\nRabbits have a thick, soft undercoat and a longer outer coat that's often thicker at the back than on the belly. The fur is usually straight or slightly wavy, and its texture can vary depending on breed, with some having shorter, smoother coats (e.g., Californian) and others having longer, coarser coats (e.g., Angora). The fur of a healthy rabbit is lustrous and well-groomed, with no matting or tangling.\n\n**Ear type:**\nRabbits have long ears that are set high on the head. The ear shape can vary depending on breed, but most rabbits have erect, forward-facing ears. Some breeds, such as Polish rabbits, have ears that droop downward, while others (e.g., English Angoras) have shorter ears.\n\n**Leg build:**\nRabbits have strong, compact legs with powerful hind legs designed for speed and agility. Their front legs are relatively short but well-muscled for grasping and holding onto food or objects. Rabbits' back legs are longer and more muscular, allowing them to jump high and cover significant distances quickly.\n\n**Additional features:**\nSome other notable external features of healthy adult rabbits include:\n\n* A flat, broad head with a distinct forehead and whiskers\n* Large, dark eyes that are often round in shape\n* Long, sharp front teeth (incisors) used for cutting and grinding food\n* Strong, sharp claws on their paws for digging, grasping, and climbing\n\nKeep in mind that individual rabbits may have unique features depending on breed, genetics, and environmental factors.
