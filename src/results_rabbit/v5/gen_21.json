This ability helps the rabbit to detect potential threats from a distance and also aids in balance and equilibrium.\n\n**Limb Structure:** Rabbits have slender limbs that are well-suited for movement and agility. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their front legs, which allows them to jump and hop with ease. The forelimbs are shorter but more robust, with powerful shoulder muscles that enable the rabbit to dig and burrow.\n\n**Body Shape:** Adult rabbits typically have a compact, rounded body shape, with a broad chest and well-defined shoulders. Their backs are generally straight or slightly curved, depending on their breed, and their bellies are usually smooth and flat.\n\nOverall, adult rabbits are characterized by their small stature, diverse coat patterns, distinctive pointed ears, and slender limbs, which all contribute to their unique appearance and remarkable agility.",
