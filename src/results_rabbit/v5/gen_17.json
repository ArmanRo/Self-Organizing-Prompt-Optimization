Their eyes are positioned on either side of their nose, providing them with wide peripheral vision.\n\n- Whiskers: Most rabbits have noticeable whiskers or vibrissae around their mouth and chin area. These hair-like structures help detect food and objects in the dark, acting as a tactile aid.",

The texture of the fur can vary depending on the breed, but it's usually soft to the touch. The coat color can range from solid whites and grays to browns, blacks, and a variety of patterns and combinations.\n\n**Ears:**\nOne of the most distinctive features of rabbits is their ears, which are relatively large compared to their head size. Rabbit ears are long and pointed, with a thin membrane that helps them detect even slight changes in sound waves. Their size allows them to pinpoint the source of sounds, making them highly alert to potential threats.\n\n**Facial Features:**\nThe rabbit's face is characterized by several distinct markings:\n\n* **Whiskers:** Rabbits have prominent whiskers on either side of their nose, which are actually specialized hairs called vibrissae. These sensitive hairs help detect changes in air pressure and temperature, aiding the rabbit's sense of touch.\n* **Nose and Muzzle:** The rabbit's nose is short and slightly upturned, with a distinctive black or dark-colored tip. Their muzzle is relatively long and pointed, giving them a cute, endearing appearance.\n\n**Other Key Features:**\n\n* Long hind legs that allow for impressive jumping ability\n* Strong back legs that enable rapid movement and quick changes in direction\n* Small, powerful front legs with sharp claws that help with digging and grasping\n\nOverall, an adult rabbit's physical features are perfectly adapted to its burrowing lifestyle, allowing it to navigate complex underground tunnels with ease and detect potential threats through its exceptional senses.",
