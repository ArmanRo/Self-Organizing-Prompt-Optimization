However, some breeds can be smaller or larger than this range.\n\n**Coat Texture:** Rabbits have a short, smooth coat that is often referred to as a \"short-coat.\" This texture helps to reduce heat retention and facilitates easy grooming. The fur is usually soft and fine, with a subtle sheen.\n\n**Ears:** Rabbits are known for their **long ears**, which can reach up to 3-4 inches (7-10 cm) in length. These ears are extremely mobile and play a crucial role in detecting sounds and maintaining balance.\n\n**Facial Markings:** A rabbit's face is characterized by several distinctive markings, including:\n\n* **Whiskers**: Long, stiff hairs around the mouth that help detect food and navigate through tight spaces.\n* **Furrows**: Deep grooves or lines on the forehead, just above the eyes.\n* **Ridges**: Prominent ridges on either side of the nose.\n* **Eyebrows**: Thick, expressive eyebrows that add to a rabbit's endearing expression.\n\nOverall, these physical attributes contribute to a rabbit's unique appearance and help make them one of the most recognizable and beloved small mammals.",

This makes them one of the smaller mammalian pets commonly kept as companions.\n\n**Coat Texture:** Rabbits have short coats that can vary in texture and length depending on their breed. However, most rabbits have soft, thick undercoats with a smoother outer layer that lies close to the body.\n\n**Ears:** One of the rabbit's most distinctive features is its long ears, which are incredibly sensitive and help the animal detect even slight sounds. These ears can be quite large in comparison to the rest of the head and are often held erect or slightly angled forward.\n\n**Facial Markings:** Rabbits have a unique set of facial markings that include whiskers (long, thin hairs around the nose and mouth), as well as longer guard hairs on their muzzle and cheeks. These facial features contribute to their overall expressive appearance.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are many different breeds of rabbit, each with its own distinct physical characteristics, such as size, coat length, color, and ear shape.
