Here are some of its notable features:\n\n**Compact Build:** Adult rabbits have a sturdy yet compact build, which allows them to move quickly and efficiently through dense underbrush or navigate tight spaces with ease. Their body shape is typically rounded, with a short back and a well-sprung loin (the area between the ribs and hips).\n\n**Medium Size:** Rabbits come in a range of sizes depending on their breed, but most adult rabbits typically weigh between 2-12 pounds (1-5.5 kg) and stand about 10-20 inches (25-50 cm) tall at the shoulder.\n\n**Plush Fur:** One of the rabbit's most distinctive features is its luxurious fur, which can be found in a wide range of colors and textures depending on the breed. The fur is soft, thick, and plush, with individual hairs that lie flat against the skin to create a velvety texture.\n\n**Distinctive Pointed Ears:** Rabbits are perhaps best known for their iconic ears, which are long, thin, and pointed at the tips. These ears serve several important functions, including helping the rabbit to detect predators, regulate its body temperature, and even balance while running or making sharp turns.\n\n**Sensitive Whisker-like Facial Hairs:** Adult rabbits have highly sensitive whiskers that grow from their face, particularly around the muzzle (the area just below the nose). These hairs are extremely sensitive and help the rabbit navigate through tight spaces, detect changes in its environment, and even gauge the distance to objects.\n\nOverall, the adult rabbit's physical features make it a unique and fascinating creature, well-suited to its role as a nimble and resourceful herbivore.",
