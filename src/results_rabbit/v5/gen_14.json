Their height at the shoulder can range from 10-14 inches (25-35 cm).\n\n**Coat Texture:** Rabbits have a thick, double coat that helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. The outer layer is coarse and water-repellent, while the undercoat is soft and fluffy.\n\n**Color Pattern:** Adult rabbits come in a wide range of colors and patterns, including solid colors like black, white, gray, brown, and red; bi-colored patterns (e.g., black and white); and pointed or agouti patterns (with banding on their fur). Some common color combinations include:\n\n* Dutch: White with orange or cream markings\n* Californian: White with black markings\n* Champagne Agouti: Light golden-brown with darker banding\n\n**Ears:** Rabbits have relatively long ears that are highly mobile, allowing them to pinpoint sounds and detect potential threats. Their ears are usually rounded at the tips and can be erect or laid back depending on their mood.\n\n**Eyes:** Adult rabbits have large, dark eyes that are positioned on either side of their head, giving them excellent peripheral vision. Their eye color can vary from brown, black, or gray to golden, hazel, or even blue (in some breeds).\n\n**Nose:** Rabbits have a pinkish-gray nose that is relatively small and rounded.\n\n**Distinctive Fur Markings:** Rabbits often have distinctive markings on their fur, such as:\n\n* Whisker marks: Dark stripes running along the sides of their muzzle\n* Face patch: A dark mark or smudge on the forehead\n* Back stripe: A narrow strip of darker fur running down their back\n\nThese markings can vary in intensity and pattern depending on the rabbit's breed and individual characteristics.\n\nOverall, an average adult rabbit is a delightful combination of soft, fluffy fur; expressive eyes; and an endearing face that will melt your heart.",

This is why they are often described as having \"short legs\" or being \"low-slung.\"\n\n2.  **Fur**: Their fur can vary in color and texture depending on the breed but generally, it's soft and dense over much of their body. Some breeds have longer hair that requires regular grooming.\n\n3.  **Ears**: Rabbits are known for having long ears compared to other mammals. These ears help them detect predators from a distance and contribute significantly to their balance.\n\n4.  **Teeth**: Rabbits have continuously growing incisors (front teeth) which they use constantly for eating, cutting, and gnawing on wood or hard objects. Their molars are not as prominent but help in grinding food.\n\n5.  **Paws and Hind Legs**: Rabbits are agile due to their powerful hind legs that enable them to jump long distances with ease. Their paws have a soft, padded underside which helps reduce noise when they move around.\n\n6.  **Tail**: While rabbits do not have tails like many other animals, some breeds might have short hair or tufts at the end of their spine, often mistaken for a tail.\n\n7.  **Size and Weight**: The size can vary widely depending on the breed but most adult rabbits are between 8 to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kilograms), with some larger breeds reaching up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms) or more.\n\nThese characteristics make rabbits one of the most recognizable and endearing pets worldwide, known for their ability to hop around quickly and efficiently.",

Some rabbits sport short, smooth coats while others have longer, more luscious fur, often with a wispy undercoat for added depth.\n\n**Distinctive Features**\n\nTheir eyes are large and round, shining bright like dark chocolate jewels that sparkle with curiosity. Whiskers – those sensitive sentinels of the rabbit's world – sprout from their muzzle, providing vital sensory information to navigate their surroundings. Their small, button-like nose twitches as they sniff out treats or detect subtle changes in their environment.\n\n**Proportional Balance**\n\nEvery aspect of a domesticated rabbit's appearance seems designed to complement its inner nature. The size and shape of their ears are perfectly balanced with the rest of their head and body, creating an harmonious equilibrium that belies their lively spirit. Their long hind legs propel them forward with surprising speed and agility, while their compact front end allows for effortless navigation through tight spaces.\n\n**Vibrant Personality**\n\nBut beneath this pleasing physical façade lies a rabbit's true charm: its gentle nature. Their calm demeanor is contagious, spreading peacefulness wherever they roam. With an innate curiosity that keeps them exploring and learning, domesticated rabbits are playful yet not overly energetic, content to lounge in the sun or enjoy a quiet evening in their cozy burrow.\n\n**Harmonious Balance**\n\nThe relationship between a rabbit's physical traits and its inner nature is truly symbiotic. Their endearing appearance – those adorable ears, whiskers, and coat – perfectly complements their friendly disposition, creating an irresistible combination that captivates the hearts of all who meet them. Whether lounging in a sunny meadow or snuggled up on a lap, domesticated rabbits embody the very essence of harmonious balance: a beautiful union of form and function, personality and physicality.",

Its body shape is generally rounded, indicating that it has a compact build with a tendency to store fat around the abdomen. On average, an adult rabbit measures between 25-30 inches (63-76 cm) in length, including its tail.\n\nThe coat of a typical rabbit is short and smooth, consisting of individual hairs rather than being made up of longer guard hairs and undercoat as seen in some other mammals. This texture contributes to their overall clean appearance and makes grooming relatively simple for the animal. One distinctive feature of rabbits is the long ears that protrude from the top of its head. These are not only sensitive organs but also play a role in communication.\n\nFacially, adult rabbits often have prominent facial markings that include whiskers or vibrissae on either side of the nose and upper lip. These highly innervated hairs serve as sensors to detect objects and changes in their environment, adding to the rabbit's ability to navigate and find food efficiently.
