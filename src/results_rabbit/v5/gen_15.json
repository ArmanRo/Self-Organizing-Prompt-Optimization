They have a compact, sturdy body with long ears and hind legs relative to their body size.\n\nTheir fur is soft, smooth, and dense, often in shades of brown or gray but can be white, black, or spotted depending on the breed. The coloration may vary across different regions of their body, including the face, back, belly, and extremities. Some rabbits also have a lighter-colored underside to help with camouflage.\n\nRabbits have large eyes that are positioned relatively high on their head for wide field vision, allowing them to detect predators from afar. Their nose is small but sensitive, enabling them to sniff out food sources effectively. The teeth in an adult rabbit are continuously growing and need to be trimmed regularly to prevent overgrowth.\n\nTheir front paws have long nails that are similar to human fingernails and their hind legs have powerful muscles for jumping and running. Rabbits can grow up to about 20 inches (50 cm) in length, with the average weight varying between breeds but generally ranging from 8 pounds to 12 pounds (3.5 kg to 5.4 kg). Overall, adult rabbits are known for their agility, speed, and remarkable ability to move quickly out of harm's way when needed.",

                "response": "A typical adult rabbit has several distinct physical attributes that contribute to its endearing and recognizable appearance. Some of the key characteristics include:\n\n1.  **Rounded Body Shape**: Rabbits have a rounded body shape with a compact torso and relatively short legs. This is in contrast to many other mammals, which tend to have longer bodies or more elongated limbs.\n\n2.  **Average Weight**: The average weight of an adult rabbit can vary significantly based on its breed. Some breeds can be quite small, weighing around 1-3 pounds (0.5-1.5 kilograms), while others can weigh up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms) or more. So, it's challenging to provide a single figure for the average weight of an adult rabbit.\n\n3.  **Medium-Length Coat Texture**: Rabbits have a medium-length coat that can be quite thick in some breeds. This coat texture is designed to protect them from cold temperatures and also serves as a means of communication with other rabbits through their scent and appearance.\n\n4.  **Long Ears**: One of the most distinctive features of adult rabbits is their long ears. These are extremely sensitive, allowing the rabbit to detect even slight changes in its environment, such as predators or food sources.\n\n5.  **Distinctive Facial Features**: Rabbits have several distinctive facial features that contribute to their unique appearance. These include whiskers and a nose print. The whiskers act as highly sensitive touch sensors, helping the rabbit navigate through tight spaces or detect potential threats. The nose print is unique to each rabbit, much like human fingerprints, making it a valuable tool for identification.",

Here are some of the key characteristics:\n\n1. **Rounded Body Shape**: Rabbits have a compact, rounded body shape with a broad chest and well-sprung ribs. Their torso is relatively short compared to their hindquarters, which are longer and more muscular.\n\n2. **Overall Average Weight**: The average weight for an adult rabbit can vary significantly based on its breed. Some smaller breeds like the Netherland Dwarf or Polish rabbit weigh around 1.5-3.5 pounds (0.7-1.6 kilograms), while larger breeds, such as the Flemish Giant, can reach weights of over 28 pounds (12.7 kilograms).\n\n3. **Medium-Length Coat Texture**: Rabbits have a thick undercoat and a longer, coarser top coat that can be either short or long depending on the breed. This combination provides them with excellent insulation from cold temperatures but can also make them susceptible to heat stress in warmer climates.\n\n4. **Long Ears**: One of the most recognizable features of rabbits is their extremely long ears, which are incredibly sensitive and help them detect predators more effectively. These ears can reach up to 13 inches (33 cm) or longer in some larger breeds.\n\n5. **Distinctive Facial Features**: Rabbits have a number of distinctive facial features that contribute to their unique appearance:\n   - **Whiskers**: Long, stiff hairs above the eyes called vibrissae or whiskers, which are highly sensitive and help with navigation and sensing objects.\n   - **Nose Print**: Each rabbit's nose print is unique, just like human fingerprints. It's made up of a pattern of little ridges on the tip of their nose and can be used to identify individual rabbits.\n\nThese physical attributes, combined with their agile movements and varied coat colors (including solid, tortoiseshell, agouti, pointed, and more), make adult rabbits quite recognizable and fascinating animals.",

This description provides a general idea of the external features and physical traits commonly found in healthy adult rabbits.",
