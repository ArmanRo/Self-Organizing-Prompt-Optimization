Its length averages around 14-16 inches (35-40 cm) for larger breeds and smaller for dwarf or mini breeds. The overall size can vary depending on the breed.\n\n**Coat:**\nOne of the most distinctive features of adult rabbits is their thick, dense coat. It's usually composed of two layers:\n\n*   A soft undercoat that provides insulation\n*   A coarser outer layer with guard hairs that repel water and debris\n\nThe coat can vary in length and texture depending on the breed, but it often appears velvety to the touch.\n\n**Ear Shape:**\nRabbits have long ears that are typically wide at the base and taper towards the tip. Their ears are extremely mobile and can rotate 180 degrees to detect sounds from all directions.\n\n**Facial Features:**\n\n*   **Whiskers:** Rabbits have prominent whiskers on their muzzle, which help them detect objects in dark or poorly lit areas.\n*   **Nostrils:** Their nostrils are relatively large compared to other mammals, allowing for efficient oxygen intake and carbon dioxide release.\n*   **Eyes:** Rabbits' eyes are positioned on the sides of their head, giving them almost 360-degree vision.",

                "response": "An adult rabbit is a sturdy and compact creature with several distinct physical attributes that make it easily recognizable.\n\n**Compact, Oval-Shaped Body:**\nThe core of the rabbit's physical appearance is its compact, oval-shaped body. Adult rabbits typically measure between 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) in length, excluding their ears, which can add an additional 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) to their overall height. Their bodies are well-proportioned and symmetrical, allowing them to move with ease through tight spaces.\n\n**Thick, Dense Coat:**\nOne of the most notable features of a rabbit's physical appearance is its thick, dense coat. Rabbits have two layers of fur: a soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer layer. This double-layered coat helps protect them from harsh weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures and precipitation. The color and texture of their fur can vary depending on the breed, but most rabbits have a thick, plush coat that's often described as \"velvety\" or \"soft to the touch.\"\n\n**Distinctive Ear Shape:**\nRabbits are known for their distinctive ear shape, which is long and pointed at the tips. Their ears are mobile and extremely sensitive, allowing them to detect even the slightest sounds. This unique ear structure helps rabbits navigate their surroundings with ease.\n\n**Notable Facial Features:**\nA rabbit's face is characterized by several notable features:\n\n* **Prominent Whiskers:** Rabbits have long, stiff whiskers that help them detect changes in air pressure and temperature. These whiskers are highly sensitive and play a crucial role in their spatial awareness.\n* **Large Eyes:** Rabbits have large, expressive eyes that are positioned on either side of their head. Their eyes are relatively small compared to their overall body size but are incredibly perceptive, allowing them to detect even the slightest movements.\n* **Short Snout:** Rabbits have a short, compact snout that's perfectly adapted for grazing and nibbling on plant material.\n\nIn summary, an adult rabbit is characterized by its compact, oval-shaped body, thick, dense coat, distinctive ear shape, and notable facial features, including prominent whiskers, large eyes, and a short snout.",

Despite their compact size, rabbits are surprisingly agile and can move with remarkable speed and grace.\n\n**Coat Textures:**\nOne of the most striking features of a rabbit's coat is its incredible variety of textures. Rabbits have three main types of coats:\n\n* **Short-haired breeds**: These rabbits have a smooth, glossy coat that lies flat against their body.\n* **Medium-haired breeds**: These rabbits have a coat with a soft, fluffy texture and often require regular grooming to prevent matting.\n* **Long-haired breeds**: These rabbits have a luxurious, flowing coat that requires frequent brushing to prevent knotting.\n\n**Ear Shape:**\nRabbits are renowned for their exceptional hearing, which is partly due to the unique shape of their ears. Their ears are long and narrow, with a distinctive \"V\" shape at the tips. This ear structure allows rabbits to pinpoint sounds from great distances and detect even slight changes in their surroundings.\n\n**Limb Structure:**\nRabbits have remarkably agile limbs that enable them to move with incredible speed and agility. They possess:\n\n* **Strong hind legs**: Their powerful back legs allow rabbits to jump long distances, often reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour (40 km/h).\n* **Elongated forelimbs**: Rabbits' front legs are longer than their hind legs, giving them a remarkable ability to stretch and reach for food or other objects.\n* **Strong clawed paws**: Rabbits have sharp claws on their front and back paws that help them grip surfaces, climb up walls, and dig burrows with ease.\n\nIn summary, an average adult rabbit is characterized by its compact size, varied coat textures, distinctive ear shape, and agile limb structure. These physical attributes enable rabbits to thrive in a wide range of environments and make them one of the most fascinating animals on our planet.",

Their front legs are stronger than their hind legs, which enables them to push themselves up onto their hind legs when standing or running. Their back legs are also powerful, allowing them to jump long distances with ease. Rabbits have five claws on each foot, which provide traction and help prevent slipping.\n\n**Other Distinctive Features:** In addition to their size, coat texture, ear shape, and limb structure, rabbits often exhibit other distinctive features, such as:\n\n* Bright, alert eyes that are often a dark brown or black color\n* A strong, muscular body with a prominent chest and well-defined shoulders\n* A short, compact tail that is usually carried low when the rabbit is at rest\n\nOverall, an average adult rabbit is a compact, agile creature with a distinctive appearance that reflects its unique combination of physical attributes.",
