Their long ears are incredibly mobile and help them hear even the faintest sounds from far away.\n\n**Body Length:**\nA typical rabbit is about 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) long, including their tail. They usually weigh between 2-4 pounds (1-2 kg), depending on the breed.\n\n**Legs and Paws:**\nRabbits have short, powerful legs that are well-suited for hopping. Their paws are small, soft, and have five toes each. The hind legs are stronger than the front legs, which helps them propel themselves forward when they hop.\n\n**Tail (or Nether Regions):**\nA rabbit's tail is relatively long and fluffy, helping to balance their body as they move around. Female rabbits also have a distinctive reproductive system located in the rear of their body, just like other female mammals.\n\n**Coat:**\nRabbits come in a wide range of coat types and colors, from soft and fluffy to wiry and straight.

They help the rabbit detect sounds and maintain balance.\n\n**Eyes and eye sockets:** The eyes are relatively small, bead-like in shape, and positioned on either side of the head just below the ears. Eye sockets are moderately deep, indicating a moderate to large size for the eyes.\n\n**Mouth and nose structure:** The snout is short and pointed, with a slightly rounded tip. The nostrils (nostrils) are relatively small and positioned near the base of the snout.\n\n**Neck and shoulder region:** The neck is long and slender, allowing the rabbit to nod its head easily. The shoulders are sloping, which helps the animal balance when running or changing direction quickly.\n\n**Body proportions:** Rabbits have a relatively short back leg (thigh) compared to their front legs (shoulder). This is reflected in their stride pattern, with a \"loping\" gait that covers ground efficiently but might not be as agile or flexible as other animals.\n\n**Tail structure:** Rabbits do not have tails (or very small ones), which helps them move more easily through dense vegetation and reduces the risk of tail injury during escape maneuvers.\n\nOverall, the rabbit's morphology is well-suited to its natural habitat: open fields, meadows, and brushlands where speed, agility, and rapid changes in direction are essential for survival.",

The color and texture of the coat can vary depending on the breed.\n\n**Ears:** Rabbits have long, pointed ears that are very mobile and highly sensitive to sound. They are usually carried upright when alert or relaxed, but can be folded back against the head for protection.\n\n**Head:** The rabbit's head is relatively large compared to its body, with a short, blunt muzzle and a pair of small, bead-like eyes. The nose is generally pink in color and moist.\n\n**Legs and Feet:** Rabbits have long, powerful hind legs that are well-suited for jumping and running. Their front legs are shorter and more compact, but still strong enough to support their body weight. Their feet are large and padded, with sharp claws for digging and grasping.\n\n**Tail:** Rabbits have a relatively short tail that is often carried low or tucked in when they're feeling nervous or threatened.\n\nOverall, the typical rabbit has a robust, athletic build that's well-suited for its active lifestyle as a herbivore.",
