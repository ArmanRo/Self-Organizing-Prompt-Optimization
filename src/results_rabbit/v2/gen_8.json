                "response": "Adult rabbits come in a wide range of sizes, breeds, and colors, but here are some common physical attributes that describe many species:\n\n**Size:**\nRabbits typically weigh between 2-12 pounds (1-5.4 kg), with an average weight of around 8-10 pounds (3.6-4.5 kg). They usually reach their full size between 4-9 months of age, depending on the breed.\n\n**Coat Texture:**\nRabbit coats can vary in texture, but most are soft and dense. The length and thickness of the coat depend on the breed, with some rabbits having short, smooth coats (e.g., Mini Lops) and others having longer, thicker coats (e.g., Angoras). The fur is usually double-layered, with a soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer layer.\n\n**Eye Color:**\nRabbit eyes can range in color from dark brown to golden yellow, blue-gray, or even multicolored. Some breeds have distinctive eye colors, such as the Chinchilla's bright blue eyes or the English Angora's golden-yellow eyes.\n\n**Ear Shape:**\nRabbits have relatively large ears that are long and pointed at the tips. The shape and size of the ears can vary between breeds, but most rabbits have ears that are around 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) long.\n\n**Nose Profile:**\nA rabbit's nose is usually short and slightly upturned, with a slight concave curve. Some breeds, such as the Dwarf Hotot, may have a more prominent or flatter nose profile.\n\n**Additional Physical Attributes:**\n\n* Body shape: Rabbits are typically compact and muscular, with a rounded body and long hind legs.\n* Fur color: While most rabbits have solid colors (e.g., black, white, brown), many breeds have distinctive markings, such as the Holland Lop's mottled or \"tuxedo\" pattern.\n* Weight distribution: Rabbits tend to carry their weight in their hindquarters, which is why they often appear slightly heavier behind than in front.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general descriptions, and individual rabbits can exhibit variations depending on breed, genetics, and overall health.",

Males tend to be slightly larger than females.\n\n**Body Shape:**\nRabbits have a compact, sturdy body with a rounded shape. Their back is straight or slightly curved, and they have a short, strong neck. Their limbs are well-muscled and sturdy, with powerful hind legs that enable them to jump great distances.\n\n**Coat:**\nThe coat of an adult rabbit varies depending on the breed, but most rabbits have a thick, soft undercoat covered by a longer, coarser outer layer. The color of their coat can range from white, black, brown, gray, and tan, or any combination thereof, including patterns like spotted, striped, or pointed.\n\n**Eye Color:**\nRabbits' eyes are large and expressive, with a relatively small eye socket due to their skull structure. Their eye color is highly variable and depends on the breed, but common colors include brown, blue, gray, gold, copper, and even heterochromia (different colored eyes).\n\n**Ear Length:**\nOne of the most distinctive features of rabbits are their long, powerful ears! On average, an adult rabbit's ears can measure between 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length. Their ears are incredibly mobile, helping them detect predators and navigate their environment.\n\n**Nostril Prominence:**\nRabbits have relatively small nostrils compared to other mammals, which are positioned at the top of their muzzle. The nostrils are often slightly visible when they breathe in or out, but they're not usually prominent unless the rabbit is excited, stressed, or ill.\n\nOverall, adult rabbits are delightful creatures with unique physical attributes that make them a joy to behold!",
