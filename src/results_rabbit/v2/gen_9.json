                "response": "Here are the average adult rabbit's characteristics:\n\n**Size:**\nThe average adult rabbit typically weighs between 8-12 pounds (3.6-5.4 kg) and measures approximately 15-20 inches (38-51 cm) in length, including their tail. Males tend to be slightly larger than females.\n\n**Fur Texture:**\nRabbits have a thick, double coat of fur that provides excellent insulation against temperature fluctuations. The undercoat is soft, dense, and fine, while the outer coat is longer, coarser, and more protective. The fur can vary in length depending on the breed, but most rabbits have a moderate-length coat that reaches their paws or knees.\n\n**Eye Color:**\nRabbits' eye colors range from bright, expressive brown to pale blue, gray, or even gold. Some breeds may have bi-colored eyes, with one color dominating the other. The shape of the eye is generally rounded and wide-set, giving rabbits an endearing and alert appearance.\n\n**Ear Shape:**\nOne of the most distinctive features of rabbits is their long, thin ears, which can reach up to 5-6 inches (13-15 cm) in length. The ears are typically V-shaped at the tips and have a slight fold at the base, giving them a flexible yet delicate appearance.\n\n**Nose Shape:**\nRabbits' noses are relatively short and slightly rounded at the tip. They are highly sensitive to touch and smell, with a rich supply of nerve endings that help them detect subtle changes in their environment. The nose is also quite mobile, allowing rabbits to use it for sensing and sniffing.\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n* **Body Type:** Rabbits have long, powerful hind legs and shorter front legs, which enable them to hop efficiently. Their torso is generally muscular and compact.\n* **Tail:** Rabbits' tails are relatively short (around 2-3 inches or 5-7.6 cm) and fluffy, often with a tuft of longer hair at the end.\n* **Grooming:** Despite their thick coat, rabbits spend a significant amount of time grooming themselves to keep their fur clean and well-maintained.\n\nKeep in mind that individual rabbits can vary slightly depending on breed, diet, and living conditions. However, these characteristics provide a general idea of what an average adult rabbit looks like.",

They weigh between 2 to 4 pounds (1-2 kg), making them one of the smallest domesticated mammals.\n\n**Fur Coat:** Their most striking feature is their fluffy fur coat, which can vary in texture and color depending on the breed. The fur is usually soft and dense, with a silky sheen that gives it a luxurious appearance. Rabbits have two layers of fur: a thick undercoat and a longer outer layer that provides protection from the elements.\n\n**Eye Color:** Rabbits' eyes are bright and expressive, with a range of colors including brown, blue, gold, and heterochromatic (different colored) eyes. Their eye color can be quite striking, with some rabbits having piercing blue or golden eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity.\n\n**Ears:** One of the most distinctive features of a rabbit is its relatively long ears, which are highly mobile and sensitive to sound. Ears are typically rounded at the tips and taper towards the base, giving them an elegant, slightly curved shape. They help rabbits to detect predators, communicate with other rabbits, and even regulate their body temperature.\n\n**Snout Shape:** Rabbits have a short snout or muzzle, which is relatively small compared to their head size. The snout is soft and flexible, allowing for easy manipulation of food and other objects. It's also highly sensitive, enabling the rabbit to detect subtle changes in its environment.\n\n**Other Features:** In addition to these key features, adult rabbits typically have strong back legs with powerful hindquarters, which enable them to jump long distances. Their front legs are slightly shorter and more delicate, but still robust enough for grasping and manipulating food.\n\nOverall, an average adult rabbit is a small, agile creature with a distinctive combination of physical characteristics that make it both endearing and fascinating to observe.",
