                "response": "**Species:** Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)\n\n**Anatomy:**\n\n1. **Skeletal System:** The domestic rabbit's skeletal system is characterized by a robust, compact body plan with a relatively short thoracic cavity and a long, curved spine. The pelvis is shallow, with a wide acetabulum for supporting the weight of the animal on its hindlimbs.\n2. **Dental Anatomy:** Rabbits have a unique dental morphology, with specialized incisors (front teeth) that are open-rooted and designed for gnawing and grinding plant material. These incisors are made of hard, yellow enamel and are continuously growing throughout their lives.\n3. **Muscular System:** The rabbit's muscular system is adapted for bipedal locomotion, with powerful hindlimb muscles and a relatively short thoracic cavity that restricts the development of large anterior limb muscles. The abdominal muscles are well-developed, providing stability during movement.\n4. **Cervical Vertebrae:** Rabbits have seven cervical vertebrae, which allow for considerable flexibility in the neck region.\n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\n\n1. **Body Shape:** Rabbits have a compact, elongated body shape with a relatively short tail (10-15 cm). The body is proportionate to the hindlimb length.\n2. **Coat and Fur:** Domestic rabbits exhibit a thick undercoat of soft, fine hairs (velvet fur) and a longer guard hair coat that provides protection against environmental stressors. Coat color varies among individuals but typically ranges from white to various shades of brown, grey, or black.\n3. **Ears:** Rabbits have long, mobile ears with an average length of 15-20 cm. These are essential for detecting predators and maintaining equilibrium during movement.\n4. **Hindlimb Structure:** Rabbits possess powerful hindlimbs with a long, straight femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone). The foot is relatively small and has five toes.\n5. **Tail:** As mentioned earlier, the rabbit's tail is short (10-15 cm), flat, and covered in soft fur.\n\n**Measurements:**\n\n* Length (including head and body): approximately 40-50 cm\n* Weight: typically ranges from 2-4 kg (depending on breed)\n\n**Other notable features:**\n\n* Rabbits are herbivores with a specialized digestive system adapted for breaking down cellulose in plant cell walls.\n* Their eyes have a unique nictitating membrane, also known as the \"third eyelid,\" which provides protection and helps keep the eyes moist.\n\nThese physical characteristics and anatomical adaptations enable domestic rabbits to thrive in their natural environments and are reflective of their evolutionary history.",
