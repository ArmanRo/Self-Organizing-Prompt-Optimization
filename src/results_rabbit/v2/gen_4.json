They come in various sizes, but most adult rabbits weigh between 2-12 pounds (1-5.4 kg), depending on the breed.\n\n**Fur Coat:** Rabbits have a thick, soft coat of fur that helps to regulate their body temperature and protect them from the elements. The length and texture of their fur can vary greatly depending on the breed, but most rabbits have a double coat: a soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer layer.\n\n**Ears:** One of the most distinctive features of rabbits is their large, long ears. These ear tufts are extremely mobile and help them detect sounds and maintain balance while moving. Some breeds, like the Holland Lop, have smaller ears, but most rabbits have relatively long ears that can reach up to 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length.\n\n**Eyes:** Rabbits have large, round eyes with a distinctive ring of skin around the iris. Their eyes are positioned on either side of their head, which gives them almost complete peripheral vision.\n\n**Nose and Teeth:** Rabbits have small, button-like noses and a pair of incisors that grow continuously throughout their lives.

Their paws are soft and padded with fur, helping them grip the ground while running or changing direction quickly.\n\n**Tail:** Most rabbits do not have a visible tail; instead, they have a fluffy patch of fur at the base of their spine that helps them balance while sitting or standing.\n\nOverall, a rabbit's physical appearance is characterized by its compact body, long ears, large eyes, and distinctive dental features. These characteristics have evolved to help rabbits survive in various environments and are essential for their ability to move efficiently and feed on plant material.",
