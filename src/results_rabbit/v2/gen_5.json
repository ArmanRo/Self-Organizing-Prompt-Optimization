                "response": "An average adult rabbit has several distinctive physical characteristics that can be easily identified. Here are some of its general physical characteristics and external features:\n\n**Size:**\n\n* Rabbits come in a variety of sizes, but an average adult rabbit typically weighs between 2-12 pounds (0.9-5.4 kg) and measures 15-28 inches (38-71 cm) in length, including their tail.\n* Some breeds can be smaller or larger than this range.\n\n**Coat:**\n\n* Rabbits have a thick, soft coat that can vary in texture, length, and color depending on the breed.\n* The coat is usually long enough to cover their body but may be shorter on the face, ears, and legs.\n* Some rabbits have a shiny or glossy coat, while others may have a duller or more matte finish.\n\n**Color:**\n\n* Rabbits come in a wide range of colors and patterns, including solid, agouti (mottled), tortoiseshell, calico, and tabby.\n* The most common colors are white, black, brown, gray, and tan.\n\n**Head:**\n\n* The rabbit's head is relatively small compared to its body and has a rounded shape.\n* They have large, dark eyes that are positioned on the sides of their head, giving them a wide range of vision.\n* Rabbits have long, mobile ears that can rotate independently to detect sounds from various directions.\n\n**Body:**\n\n* The rabbit's body is typically compact and muscular, with strong hind legs and sharp claws for digging and jumping.\n* They have a short neck and a relatively small chest, which helps them navigate through tight spaces.\n\n**Tail:**\n\n* Rabbits have long, fluffy tails that are often used as an indicator of their mood or alertness. When they are excited or frightened, their tail may twitch or vibrate rapidly.\n\n**Limbs:**\n\n* Rabbits have strong hind legs and sharp claws for digging and jumping.\n* Their front legs are slightly shorter than their back legs and are less muscular, but still quite agile.\n\nOverall, an average adult rabbit is a compact, furry creature with large eyes, long ears, and a distinctive tail. While individual rabbits can vary in appearance depending on breed and genetics, these physical characteristics provide a general outline of what to expect from an average adult rabbit.",

The color and pattern of the fur vary depending on the breed.\n\n**External Features:**\n\n* **Head shape**: The head is long and narrow, with a distinctive stop (the area where the muzzle meets the forehead).\n* **Ears**: Rabbits have large, triangular ears that are extremely mobile, allowing them to pick up even the faintest sounds.\n* **Eyes**: Their eyes are relatively small compared to other mammals, but they are sensitive and can see quite well in low light conditions.\n* **Nose**: The nose is short and slightly upturned.\n* **Teeth**: Rabbits have a set of large incisors (front teeth) that grow continuously throughout their lives. They also have smaller cheek teeth (molars) that help with grinding plant material.\n* **Legs and paws**: Their legs are long and slender, with powerful hind legs that enable them to jump and hop with great agility. The front legs are shorter and more delicate, but still strong enough for digging and grasping.\n* **Tail**: Rabbits do not have a visible tail like many other mammals, as their pelvis and spine are connected in such a way that it appears as though they don't have one.\n\n**Other notable features:**\n\n* **Skin**: The skin is thin and sensitive, making rabbits prone to sun damage and skin conditions.\n* **Fur lines**: Rabbits often have a distinctive \"fur line\" along their back, where the fur is longest and most dense. This can vary depending on the breed and individual rabbit.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general characteristics, and individual rabbits may exhibit variations depending on factors such as breed, genetics, and environmental influences.",
