They use their powerful hind legs to hop and gather food quickly.\n3. **Burrowing behavior:** In both back gardens and forests, rabbits dig complex burrows for shelter and protection from predators. These underground tunnels can extend several meters in length.\n4. **Social behavior:** Rabbits are social animals and often live in small groups in their natural habitats. However, they are also known to be territorial and will fiercely defend their territory against other rabbits.\n\n**Daily Habits:**\n\n1. **Eating habits:** Rabbits eat throughout the day, with a peak eating period at dawn and dusk. They can consume up to 200-300 grams (7-10 oz) of food per day.\n2. **Drinking habits:** Rabbits need access to fresh water at all times and will often visit a watering hole multiple times a day.\n3. **Resting habits:** Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during twilight hours (dawn and dusk). They spend the majority of their time resting or sleeping in their burrows.\n4. **Nesting behavior:** Female rabbits will create nests using soft materials like grasses, leaves, or fur to give birth and care for their young.\n\n**Habitat-Specific Traits:**\n\n1. **Back garden habitats:** Rabbits in back gardens tend to be more adaptable and can thrive in a variety of environments. They may still exhibit some wild behavior, such as burrowing and foraging.\n2. **Forest habitats:** Rabbits living in forests are often more wary of predators and may spend more time hiding or fleeing from potential threats. Their diet will also vary depending on the forest's vegetation.\n\nOverall, rabbits have distinct physical characteristics and behaviors that enable them to thrive in various environments. Understanding their habits and needs is essential for providing suitable care and management in both back gardens and forest habitats.",
