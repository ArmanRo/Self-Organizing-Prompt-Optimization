This group is distinct from other mammals and is characterized by its unique dental and skeletal features.\n\n* Kingdom: Animalia\n* Phylum: Chordata\n* Class: Mammalia\n* Order: Lagomorpha\n* Family: Leporidae (rabbits, hares, and pikas)\n* Genus: _Oryctolagus_ or _Sylvilagus_\n* Species: Various species, including _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (European rabbit) and _Sylvilagus floridanus_ (eastern cottontail)\n\n**Anatomical Features:**\n\nRabbits are characterized by several distinctive anatomical features that reflect their adaptations for hopping, grazing, and burrowing. Some key characteristics include:\n\n* **Dental Structure:** Rabbits have a specialized dental arrangement called \"rootless teeth.\" Their incisors (front teeth) grow continuously throughout life, while the molars (back teeth) are rootless and lack a pulp cavity.\n* **Skeletal System:**\n\t+ **Long Bones:** Rabbits have long, slender limbs with powerful muscles for jumping and hopping. The femur (thigh bone) is long and robust, while the tibia (shin bone) is shorter and more compact.\n\t+ **Pelvis:** The pelvis is shallow and wide, allowing for flexibility during jumping and burrowing activities.\n* **Cranial Features:**\n\t+ **Skull Shape:** Rabbits have a relatively small skull with a short, deep snout.\n\t+ **Ears:** Their ears are long, narrow, and pointed, which helps them detect predators and other sounds in their environment.\n* **Body Size and Coat:**\n\t+ **Size:** Rabbits vary in size depending on the species, but most adult rabbits weigh between 2-6 kg (4.4-13.2 lbs).\n\t+ **Coat:** Their coat is typically soft and dense, with guard hairs that provide protection from the elements.\n* **Other Features:**\n\t+ **Digestive System:** Rabbits have a specialized cecum, which houses a diverse community of microbes responsible for breaking down cellulose in plant cell walls.\n\t+ **Paw Structure:** Their hind legs are adapted for jumping and landing with their powerful back legs. The front paws have sharp claws for digging and grasping.\n\n**Mammalian Classification Systems:**\n\nThe rabbit's anatomy and physiology reflect its classification within the class Mammalia, which is characterized by:\n\n1. Warm-bloodedness (endothermy)\n2. Hair or fur\n3. Mammary glands (for milk production)\n4. A four-chambered heart\n5. A neocortex (complex brain structure)\n\nAdditionally, the rabbit's unique dental and skeletal features align with the lagomorph-specific characteristics that distinguish this group from other mammals.\n\n**Evolutionary Adaptations:**\n\nRabbits have evolved several specialized traits in response to their environments:\n\n1. **Hopping Ability:** Their powerful hind legs and flexible spine enable efficient locomotion.\n2. **Dental Specialization:** Rootless teeth allow for continuous growth, reducing the risk of tooth loss during foraging.\n3. **Digestive Adaptations:** The cecum houses a diverse microbiome that breaks down plant material efficiently.\n\nThese unique features have enabled rabbits to thrive in various habitats worldwide and make them an important part of many ecosystems.",
