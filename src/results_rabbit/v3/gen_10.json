Wild rabbits often have brown or gray fur with white markings on the face, throat, and belly.\n* **Ears:** Rabbits have long, velvety ears that are extremely mobile, allowing them to pinpoint sounds.\n* **Tail:** Rabbits have a short, fluffy tail.\n* **Size:** Domesticated rabbits range from 2-12 pounds (1-5.4 kg), while wild rabbits typically weigh between 2-8 pounds (0.9-3.6 kg).\n\n**Typical Behaviors:**\n\n* **Habitat:** Rabbits are primarily terrestrial, living in burrows or warrens.\n* **Diet:** Rabbits are herbivores, feeding on plants, fruits, and vegetables.\n* **Social behavior:** Domesticated rabbits can be social animals and thrive with companionship. Wild rabbits often live in small groups, but are generally solitary.\n* **Communication:** Rabbits use a variety of vocalizations (e.g., grunting, snorting), body language, and scent marking to communicate.\n* **Activity patterns:** Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during twilight hours. In domestic settings, rabbits can be trained to follow regular schedules.\n\n**Notable differences between domesticated and wild rabbits:**\n\n* Domesticated rabbits often lack the fear response typical of wild rabbits.\n* Wild rabbits have adapted to their environments through generations, developing specific survival strategies (e.g., burrowing, predator avoidance).\n* Domesticated rabbits may require more social interaction and mental stimulation than wild rabbits.\n\nKeep in mind that individual rabbit behavior can vary depending on breed, environment, and life experiences.",
