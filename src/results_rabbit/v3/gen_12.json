The typical physical characteristics of rabbits include:\n\n* **Body shape:** Rabbits have a compact, oval-shaped body with a short neck and legs.\n* **Fur:** They have thick, soft fur that varies in color depending on the breed or species (e.g., white, brown, gray, black).\n* **Ears:** Rabbits have long, rounded ears that are extremely mobile and can be rotated independently to detect sound.\n* **Teeth:** Their front teeth, also known as incisors, grow continuously throughout their lives and are used for gnawing and cutting vegetation.\n* **Paws:** Rabbits have strong, clawed paws with a unique bone structure that allows them to jump long distances.\n\n**Behavioral Traits:**\n\nRabbits exhibit a range of behaviors that are shaped by their natural environment and evolutionary history. Some typical behaviors include:\n\n* **Burrowing:** Rabbits are skilled burrowers, using their powerful hind legs and strong front paws to excavate complex tunnel systems.\n* **Foraging:** They are herbivores and spend most of their time foraging for food, using their keen sense of smell and taste to select edible plants.\n* **Social behavior:** Domesticated rabbits can be kept in pairs or groups and enjoy interacting with each other, while wild rabbits tend to live solitary lives.\n* **Resting:** Rabbits are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during twilight hours (dawn and dusk), when they rest during the day.\n\n**Domesticated Environments:**\n\nIn domestic environments, rabbits exhibit a range of behaviors influenced by their human caregivers. Some typical characteristics include:\n\n* **Tame behavior:** Domesticated rabbits can become highly socialized to humans and may even learn to perform tricks.\n* **Adjustments to living space:** Rabbits will adapt their burrowing behavior to fit the dimensions of their enclosure, creating complex tunnel systems within cages or hutches.\n* **Food and water consumption:** Domesticated rabbits have learned to associate feeding times with human presence, often following owners for food and water.\n\n**Free-Living Environments:**\n\nIn their natural habitat, wild rabbits exhibit behaviors shaped by predation pressure, competition for resources, and environmental challenges. Some typical characteristics include:\n\n* **Migration patterns:** Rabbits are known to migrate between summer and winter habitats in response to changing vegetation conditions.\n* **Predator avoidance:** They have a keen sense of smell and hearing that helps them detect predators, such as hawks, owls, foxes, and coyotes.\n* **Communication:** Wild rabbits use a range of vocalizations (e.g., grunting, thumping) to signal alarm or alert other members of their group to potential threats.\n\nOverall, the physical characteristics and behaviors of rabbits are shaped by both their evolutionary history and environmental pressures.",
