                "response": "The wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a remarkable creature with several distinctive physical characteristics and behaviors that enable it to thrive in its natural habitat.\n\n**Physical Appearance:**\n\n* **Coat:** The wild European rabbit has a thick, soft coat of fur that varies in color from light brown to dark gray, often with a reddish tint on the head, back, and legs. The coat is longest around the shoulders and hindquarters.\n* **Ears:** The ears are relatively short, rounded at the tips, and carried close to the body. They are not as large or prominent as those of domestic rabbits.\n* **Tail:** The tail is small, thin, and often hidden beneath the body when the rabbit is alert or moving.\n* **Legs:** The legs are robust and powerful, with strong muscles that enable the rabbit to jump long distances.\n* **Size:** Adult wild European rabbits typically weigh between 1.5-3.5 kg (3.3-7.7 lbs) and reach a body length of approximately 40-50 cm (15.7-19.7 in).\n\n**Behavioral Traits:**\n\n* **Jumping Ability:** Wild European rabbits are renowned for their impressive jumping ability, which allows them to cover distances of up to 6 meters (20 feet) in a single bound.\n* **Nocturnal Foraging:** Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk. However, they also forage at night, often under the cover of darkness, to avoid predators.\n* **Territorial Markings:** Rabbits use scent markings to define their territory, particularly during the breeding season. They deposit feces in specific locations, which contain pheromones that signal ownership and reproductive status.\n* **Agile Movements:** Rabbits are remarkably agile, able to change direction quickly and move with ease through dense vegetation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Wild European rabbits often live in groups, known as \"warrens,\" which can consist of several females (does) and their young. These warrens provide protection from predators and harsh environmental conditions.\n* Rabbits are well-adapted to their environment, with specialized features such as large eyes for detecting movement at night and strong hind legs that enable them to leap away from predators.\n\nOverall, the wild European rabbit's unique combination of physical characteristics and behaviors has allowed it to thrive in a wide range of habitats across Europe, from grasslands to woodlands.",

Here's an in-depth description of its physical appearance and behaviors:\n\n**Physical Appearance:**\n\n* **Fur:** The European rabbit's fur is soft, thick, and woolly, with a distinctive sandy-brown coloration on the back, gradating to white or light brown on the underside.\n* **Ears:** The ears are relatively short, rounded at the tips, and held upright when alert. They are slightly longer in proportion to body size than those of domestic rabbits.\n* **Tail:** The tail is short, barely visible, and typically not used for balance or communication, unlike some other rabbit species.\n* **Body:** European rabbits have a robust build, with sturdy legs and long hindlimbs that facilitate impressive jumping abilities.\n* **Size:** Adults typically reach 40-50 cm (16-20 in) in length, including their tail, and weigh between 1.5-2.5 kg (3.3-5.5 lbs).\n\n**Behaviors:**\n\n* **Jumping Ability:** European rabbits are renowned for their remarkable jumping ability, which allows them to cover great distances quickly and easily navigate complex terrain.\n* **Nocturnal Foraging:** These animals are primarily nocturnal, meaning they do most of their foraging at night. They use their keen senses of smell and hearing to locate food sources.\n* **Territorial Markings:** European rabbits engage in scent marking by depositing strong-smelling secretions from their anal glands on prominent objects like rocks, trees, or burrow entrances. This helps establish territorial boundaries and communicate with other members of the same species.\n* **Agile Movements:** Rabbits are incredibly agile and can change direction rapidly, thanks to their flexible spine, long hindlimbs, and large ears that help them balance and orient themselves in space.\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n* **Burrowing Behavior:** European rabbits are well-known for their complex burrow systems, which provide shelter from predators, extreme temperatures, and harsh weather conditions.\n* **Social Structure:** While not as social as some other rabbit species, European rabbits do form small groups or \"warrens,\" typically consisting of several females with their young and one dominant male.\n* **Habitat Adaptability:** These animals have adapted to a wide range of habitats, from arid deserts to Mediterranean scrublands and wet meadows.\n\nIn summary, the wild European rabbit is characterized by its soft fur, short ears, small tail, robust legs, impressive jumping ability, nocturnal foraging habits, territorial markings, and agile movements. Its unique combination of physical features and behavioral traits has enabled it to thrive in various environments across its native range.",
