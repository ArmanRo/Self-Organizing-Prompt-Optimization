Some rabbits have longer, more flowing fur, while others may be shorter and smoother.\n\nRabbits' softness is due to the unique structure of their fur, which has a thick undercoat that traps warm air next to their skin, keeping them cozy. This softness also helps to protect their sensitive skin from harsh winds or environmental conditions.\n\nIf you're enjoying cuddling with your pet rabbit, be sure to handle them gently and support their body weight to avoid causing any discomfort or stress. Rabbits can get nervous if handled roughly, so it's essential to respect their boundaries and provide a safe, loving environment for them to thrive.\n\nWhat's your pet rabbit's name, and what breed is it?
