                "response": "A typical rabbit is a small to medium-sized mammal with several distinct characteristics.\n\n**Fluffy Fur:**\nThe most recognizable feature of a rabbit is its thick, soft, and fluffy fur, which covers its body evenly. The fur is usually shorter on the face, ears, and legs, but longer on the back, belly, and sides. This distinctive coat helps to protect the rabbit from extreme temperatures, harsh weather conditions, and predators.\n\n**Average Adult Size:**\nRabbits typically range in size from about 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) in length, including their tail. They usually weigh between 2 and 4 pounds (0.9-1.8 kg), although some breeds can be larger or smaller.\n\n**Burrowing Habits:**\nRabbits are natural burrowers and spend a significant amount of time digging underground tunnels and dens. They use their powerful hind legs, sharp claws, and strong front teeth to excavate complex networks of tunnels and nests in grasslands or forests. These burrows provide protection from predators, harsh weather, and extreme temperatures.\n\n**Solitary Behavior:**\nContrary to popular misconception that rabbits are social animals, most rabbits are actually solitary creatures. They have a large home range, which they mark with scent to keep other rabbits away. Rabbits usually live alone, only coming together for mating or occasionally interacting with their young kits (baby rabbits). Even when they do encounter each other, they often engage in aggressive behavior to establish dominance and maintain their territory.\n\n**Other Characteristics:**\n\n* Long ears that help them detect predators and sense their surroundings\n* Strong back legs for jumping and escaping from danger\n* Sharp teeth for gnawing on plants and other materials\n* Quick reflexes for evading predators and responding to threats\n\nOverall, a typical rabbit is a compact, fluffy, and energetic creature with impressive burrowing abilities and a strong instinct for self-preservation.",
